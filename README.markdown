# YouTrack.Rest

Easy-to-use .NET client for Jetbrains' YouTrack 4.x/5.x REST API (http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack)

Latest officially tested version: __5.2.1__

Built on top of RestSharp: https://github.com/restsharp/RestSharp / http://restsharp.org
and CastleProject's DynamicProxy: https://github.com/castleproject/Castle.Core-READONLY / http://www.castleproject.org/

## Usage

```csharp

// First, create the client instance
IYouTrackClient youTrackClient = new YouTrackClient("http://youtrack.address.com", "login", "password");

// Fetching and creating issues is done using the IssueRepository
IIssueRepository issueRepository = youTrackClient.GetIssueRepository();

// Creating issue
IIssue issue = issueRepository.CreateIssue("project", "summary", "description");

// YouTrack.Rest uses Castle DynamicProxy for lazy loading which allows you to execute 
// various commands related to an issue without actually fetching the issue from YouTrack.
issue.AttachFile(@"C:\temp\foo.jpg");
issue.AddComment("blah blah");

// Using properties which use issue details will trigger a REST request:
Console.WriteLine(issue.Summary);

```

* Alright, what do I need to know?
	* In order to run Acceptance tests, you need to install YouTrack locally:
		* Install YouTrack (http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/download/get_youtrack.html)
